          <h2 class="title is-size-3 is-size-5-mobile"> What Data Do We Collect? </h2>
            <p> Our Society collects the following data:
                <dl class="pl-6">
                    <li>Personal identification information:</li>
                    <dl class="pl-5">
                        <li> Name </li>
                        <li> Email address </li>
                    </dl>
                </dl>
            </p>

          <h2 class="title is-size-3 is-size-5-mobile"> How do we collect your data? </h2>
            <p> You directly provide WDSS with all the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:
            <dl class="pl-6">
                <li> Select a word from the word pairs </li>
                <li> Submit a word along with your name and email address </li>
                <li> Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies </li>
            </dl>
            </p>
          
          <h2 class="title is-size-3 is-size-5-mobile"> How Will we use your data? </h2>
            <p>WDSS collects your data so we can:
                <dl class="pl-6">
                    <li> Perform analysis on the data for a research project </li>
                    <li> Display your word and name in a ranking if it is in the top 10 performing words </li>
                    <li> Email you in the event your word performs well </li>
                </dl>
            </p>
        <h2 class="title is-size-3 is-size-5-mobile"> How do we store your data? </h2>
            <p> WDSS securely stores your data on our cloud server hosted by Digital 
                Ocean. This is only accessible via ssh keys that require the root (admin) 
                account to approve. Digital Ocean also enforces 2FA on all accounts. 
                Data is then stored on a database which requires a separate admin password 
                to access.
            </p>
            <p> WDSS will keep your personal information for 10 weeks. 
                Once this time period has expired, we will delete your data by 
                deleting the data from our database and from any back up storage drives.
            </p>
